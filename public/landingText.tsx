<Text>David Hartman understands firsthand the challenges of intense physical pain and the dark path of opioid addiction. But it was his deep passion for the arts that ultimately became his salvation.</Text>

<Text>Years of battling conditions like osteoarthritis and degenerative disc disease forced David to leave behind his career as a machinist and tool and die maker. Desperate for relief, he turned to narcotics, only to realize the dangers they posed. Determined to find a drug-free solution, he turned to the power of art.</Text>

<Text>Starting with colored pencils and the support of his encouraging family, David explored his artistic talent. Drawing various subjects beyond copyrighted characters like Tinkerbell, he discovered a newfound sense of purpose and expression.</Text>

<Text>The breakthrough came when one of David's songs was featured in the play Hopscotch, leading to his involvement in the production and a connection with the Left Hand Artist Group. Fueling his passion for community engagement, David joined the board of directors for ArtWalk Longmont. Emerging from years of isolation and addiction, he became a catalyst for change, using art as a powerful means of healing and connection.</Text>

<Text>Today, David Hartman invites you to embark on your own transformative journey. Experience the therapeutic potential of art, a pathway to liberation from pain and addiction. Unleash your creativity, find solace in self-expression, and join a supportive community that understands your struggle.</Text>
